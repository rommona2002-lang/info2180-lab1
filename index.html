        <p>I am a very fun and open minded person who likes to try new things. I am a literature fanatic who loves to dance. I have a few skills that I aim to develop with each passing day by learning from the professionals. I have grown to love Computer Science while doing a Major in Marine Science and decided to switch over to the Department of Computing. I hope to continue to excel, learn and grow in this field. I am excited to take this course because I have always been interested in creating webpages. I am excited to see what this course will bring.</p>
